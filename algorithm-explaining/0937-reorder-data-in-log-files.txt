Input variable name is logs and the type is a list having string elements inside.
Output variable type has to be string.

To get a output, we have to distinguish digit logs from letter logs.
We can loop over the logs, log by log.
In each iteation, I'll check if each log is digit or not.
and push each log in separate variables called digit_logs and letter_logs.


All we need to care about is letter_logs order because digit_logs maintains their relative order.
So I'm going to use python built-in function "sort" to sort them by contents first and identifiers.

Finally, I'll concatenate letter_logs with digit_logs. and return it.
