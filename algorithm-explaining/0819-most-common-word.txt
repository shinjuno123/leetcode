The words in paragraph is case-insensitive 
so I need to change all the letters in the given string into lowercase letters first.
then convert all non-alphbets to a space.
and split them by a space.
Afterwards, I need to exclude banned words.

I'll use Counter python bulit-in function to count objects.
Counter function initializes a hashmap that holds the count of each of the elemments present in the hashmap.
then use most_common method of Counter function.
and choose the first one and return the key.


Time complexity is O(number of words log number of words)
