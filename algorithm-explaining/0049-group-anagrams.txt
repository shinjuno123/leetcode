Let's create a dictionary variable "anagrams" and each key is initialized with list.

First, I'll Loop over the given list, word by word
In each iteration, I'll sort each word lexicographically
and set sorted word as a key in anagrams
and then I'll append an original word to a key in anagrams.

Finally, I'll convert anagrams into a list and return it.

Time complexity is O(n * k log k)
k is the length of the word
0 <= k <= 100
1 <= n <= 10000
