I'll create a dictionary called dic.
Afterwards, I'll loop over nums with iterating variables nums and i.

In each iteration, I'll assign index number as a value and num as a key to dic.
And I'll subtract num from target and get a complement.
Then check if the complement already exists in the dic.
If it does exist in it then return the index of the complement and current index.


time complexity is O(n);
