In this Question, I need to convert uppercase letters into lowercase letters.
so Using python bulit-in-function lower, I'll convert the given string into lowercase letters.
and then It says I need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters. 
So I'll remove them by regular expression.

a String of letters is a palindrome if it is identical to its reversion.
To check if the given string is a palindrome,
I can simply walk over the string, character by character, verifying each pair of corresponding numbers.


After the loop, if the given string is not palindrome, then start will be smaller than end.
But if the given string is a palindrome, then start wll be bigger than end or equal to end.
In case the length of the given string is odd, start will be equal to end.
In case the length of the given string is even, start will be bigger than end.


Total Time complexity is O(n).
