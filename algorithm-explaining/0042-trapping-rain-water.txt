We will make 2 pointers left and right getting closer to max size of building.
While left is smaller than right, we continue to iteration.
When left is equal to right, I want to stop it.

In each iteration, I'll remember maximum left and maximum right.
As left goes to maximum height building, I'll get maximum left - height[left]
and I'll get maximum right - height[right] and add them to result.
After the iteration, I can get the total volume of trapped water.

Time complexity is O(n)
